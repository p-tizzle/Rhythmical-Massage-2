                       <p class="moreaboutMe"> I came to the idea of a third career as a Massage Therapist after having my own deeply transformative experience
                          with another kind of healing therapy.  I opened to the rising feeling that I should develop skills in my own hands to offer a form of
                          healing touch.  I was given a solid foundation in therapeutic massage techniques and human anatomy at <a class="linkS" href="http://www.advancedmassagetherapeutics.com/">
                          Advanced Massage Therapeutics</a> I expanded my knowledge of healing through trainings in Cranial Sacral Therapy and Reiki, which work
                          with both the physical and subtle bodies.  Hands on experience has deepened my understanding of the complexity of the human condition
                          and depth of healing possible through supportive and skilled touch.  All of this has woven into my most current training as a Rhythmical
                          Massage Therapist, a 3 year, 1000hr program at the <a class="linkS" href="http://www.rudolfsteinercollege.edu/"> Steiner College in California</a>.</p>
                       <p class="moreaboutMe">My life has been given depth of meaning and focused purpose by my experiences as a mother of a teeanager, soon to be
                          college student.  I have been blessed with a partner in parenting and in life for 22 years.  Ithrive on being in nature, as it has never
                          failed me to give context and perspective on everything else i do.</p>
