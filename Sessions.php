                           significant health issues, medications and specific pain will help us determine what type of massage is appropriate
                           for yourpersonalized session.  Together, we will go over and choose from a variety of  massage techniques, mentioned below,
                           to begin a general plan. This plan will evolve as more information is gathered through the hands on touch.</p>

                    <p class="paraGraph2"> The hands on portion of the session will typically last 40-50 minutes, using small quantities
                       of massage oils.  I use a combination of Very high quality olive oil as base with essential oils.  the essential oils
                       include rose, lavender, rosemary, melissa and arnica</p>

                        <p class="massageDes2">the most commonly used form of classical Western massage, generally performed in the direction
                           of the heart, sometimes with active or passive movement of the joints. It is used especially for relaxation, relief
                           of muscular tension, and improvement of circulation and range of motion.</p>
                    <h1 class="massageDes">Deep Tissue Massage</h1>
                        <p class="massageDes2">Deep tissue massage therapy is similar to Swedish massage, but the deeper pressure is beneficial
                            in releasing chronic muscle tension. The focus is on the deepest layers of muscle tissue, tendons and fascia (the protective
                            layer surrounding muscles, bones and joints).</p>

                       <p class="massageDes2">Myofascial release is a manipulative treatment that attempts to release tension in the fascia due to trauma,
                            posture, or inflammation. Connective tissues called fascia surround the muscles, bones, nerves, and organs of the body</p>

                       <p class="massageDes2">Rhythmical Massage Therapy as indicated by Dr. Ita Wegman is a gentle, harmonizing massage that helps awaken
                            the self-healing forces within each individual to promote optimal health. Through specific massage movements on the body the Rhythmical
                            Massage Therapist addresses the relationship between the body, soul and spirit by working with the life supporting forces of warmth, rhythm
                            and breathing, the interplay of levity and gravity as well as center and periphery.</p>
